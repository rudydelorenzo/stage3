<p>The Provincial Surveillance Information system (PSI) is a laboratory surveillance system which receives positive results for all Notifiable Diseases and diseases under laboratory surveillance from Alberta Precision Labs (APL). The system also receives negative results for a subset of organisms such as COVID-19. The system contains basic information on characteristics and demographics such as age, zone and gender. The Communicable Disease Reporting System (CDRS) at Alberta Health and the Communicable Disease Outbreak Management (CDOM) system at Alberta Health Services contains information on COVID-19 cases. Data Integration and Measurement Reporting (DIMR) database at Alberta Health Services contains up to date information on people admitted and discharged from hospital in Alberta. Information such as hospitalizations and ICU admissions are received through enhanced case report forms sent by Alberta Health Services (AHS).</p>
<p>COVID-19 vaccinations and AEFIs are reported to the Provincial Immunization and Adverse Reaction to Immunization (Imm/ARI) repository. In Alberta, all health practitioners are required by law to report Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) to Imm/ARI. The reporting requirements are outlined in the Immunization Regulation, under the Public Health Act. Case definitions are further defined in the AEFI Policy. As of January 1, 2021, all health practitioners are required to report all (both provincially funded and privately purchased) vaccinations electronically to Imm/ARI.

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<div id="recovered" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Recovered</h4>
<p>Active and recovered status is a surveillance definition to try to understand the number of active cases in the population. It is not related to clinical management of cases. It is based on the assumption that a case is recovered 14 days after a particular date. For confirmed cases, specimen collected date is used and for probable cases date reported to Alberta Health is used. If a case is hospitalized, the recovered date is when their symptoms have resolved based on case follow-up, or 10 days after being discharged.</p>

</div>
<div id="covid-19-deaths" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>COVID-19 Deaths</h4>
<p>A death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death identified (e.g., trauma, poisoning, drug overdose).</p>
<p>A Medical Officer of Health or relevant public health authority may use their discretion when determining if a death was due to COVID-19, and their judgement will supersede the above criteria.</p>
<p>A death due to COVID-19 may be attributed when COVID-19 is the cause of death or is a contributing factor.</p>
<p></br></p>
</div>
<div id="lab-positivity" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Lab Positivity</h4>
<p>COVID-19 percent positivity in Alberta is calculated using the Test Over Test method, which is the same method employed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The calculation is as follows:</p>
<p>Daily Number of Positive Tests / (Daily Number of Positive Tests + Daily Number of Negative Tests)
Q/RT-PCR tests are the only COVID-19 tests included in this calculation.</p>

</div>
<div id="comorbidities-1" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Comorbidities</h4>
<p>The following comorbitities are included in respective analyses: Diabetes, Hypertension, COPD, Cancer, Dementia, Stroke, Liver cirrhosis, Cardiovascular diseases (including IHD and Congestive heart failure), Chronic kidney disease, and Immuno-deficiency.</p>
<p></br></p>
</div>
<div id="vaccine-coverage" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Vaccine coverage</h4>
<p>Individuals who received at least one dose was calculated as (# of individuals who received at least one dose) / (population estimate). Those who received two doses was calculated as (# of individuals who received two doses) / (population estimate).</p>
